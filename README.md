# Sales_Data_Analysis_Project
This data analysis program reads sales data from a CSV file, processes the data to ensure correct date formats, and extracts month and city information. It then calculates and identifies the month and city with the highest total sales. The program is implemented in Python using the pandas library and outputs the results in a clear format.
